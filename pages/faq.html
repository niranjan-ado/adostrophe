            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Scan time depends on the size and complexity of the space. A typical residential property might take 1-2 hours, while a large commercial venue could take several hours or even a full day.

We can provide floor plans, point cloud data (.xyz, .pts), and reflected ceiling plans (RCP) derived directly from your 3D model.

This includes strategic scan point placement, leveraging multiple Matterport Pro cameras simultaneously if needed, and careful data stitching to ensure a seamless and comprehensive digital twin. Our team specializes in efficient capture for challenging environments."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "To ensure the best scan quality and efficiency, we recommend: decluttering, ensuring good lighting (open blinds, turn on all lights), removing sensitive information or personal items, and making sure all areas to be scanned are accessible and clean. Think of it like preparing for a professional photoshoot."

            "@type": "Answer",

While not survey-grade, they are highly sufficient for most architectural, real estate, and facilities management needs. For specific, highly precise measurements for construction, we can discuss additional services like laser scanning."

          "acceptedAnswer": {
            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "While both offer virtual walkthroughs, 360 photography for GSV is a simpler, more cost-effective solution. It provides a series of connected panoramic images for basic navigation (clicking 'chevrons' and panning). Matterport tours, on the other hand, create a full 3D 'dollhouse' view, precise measurements, and advanced interactive features like Mattertags, offering a much richer and more detailed immersive experience."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "No! One of the key advantages of 360 photography for Google Street View is that the images are hosted directly by Google on their Maps platform. This means there are no ongoing hosting fees from our side, making it a highly economical option for businesses."

          "acceptedAnswer": {
            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "When multiple 360 images are strategically captured and linked within Google Street View, users can click on the white arrow 'chevrons' that appear on the screen to virtually move from one point to another within your space. Coupled with the ability to click and drag to pan around, this creates a compelling virtual tour experience directly within Google's ecosystem."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Enhancing your Google Business Profile with 360 imagery significantly boosts engagement. It increases your visibility in local search, builds trust with potential customers by showcasing your interior, and can lead to more walk-ins and inquiries. Businesses with virtual tours on their listings are often seen as more reputable and inviting."

Educational institutions, governmental entities, and hospitals are typically not eligible."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Managing Google Ad Grants is more complex than standard Google Ads due to stringent compliance requirements and lower average bid limits. Without experienced professionals, accounts often underperform or even get suspended. Expertise is needed to navigate policy guidelines, maintain account activity, optimize for conversions within bid constraints, and ensure maximum utilization of the grant budget."

                            <p>To ensure the best scan quality and efficiency, we recommend: decluttering, ensuring good lighting (open blinds, turn on all lights), removing sensitive information or personal items, and making sure all areas to be scanned are accessible and clean. Think of it like preparing for a professional photoshoot.</p>

                            <p>We prioritize your privacy. During scanning, we advise removing or blurring sensitive information (e.g., whiteboards with proprietary data, personal photos). Matterport's platform uses secure cloud storage, and access to your models is controlled by you. We can also provide guidance on blurring faces or specific objects post-scan if required.</p>

                            <p>Matterport models provide excellent relative accuracy for interior measurements (e.g., room dimensions, door widths) typically within 1% of reality, which is highly reliable for planning, layout, and virtual staging. While not survey-grade, they are highly sufficient for most architectural, real estate, and facilities management needs. For specific, highly precise measurements for construction, we can discuss additional services like laser scanning.</p>

                            <p>Eligibility for Google Ad Grants primarily requires that your organization holds valid charity status in your respective country (e.g., 80G/12A in India) and meets specific Google guidelines, including having a high-quality website and engaging in non-discriminatory practices. Educational institutions, governmental entities, and hospitals are typically not eligible.</p>

                            <p>Managing Google Ad Grants is more complex than standard Google Ads due to stringent compliance requirements and lower average bid limits. Without experienced professionals, accounts often underperform or even get suspended. Expertise is needed to navigate policy guidelines, maintain account activity, optimize for conversions within bid constraints, and ensure maximum utilization of the grant budget.</p>
